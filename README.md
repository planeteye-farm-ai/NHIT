# Udon

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.

## Development server

**IMPORTANT:** Due to the large project size, always use npm scripts instead of direct Angular CLI commands to avoid "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**Note:** Do NOT run `ng serve` directly. Always use `npm start` which includes the necessary memory configuration.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `npm run ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` or `npm run build:prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

**Note:** Do NOT run `ng build` directly. Always use `npm run build` which includes the necessary memory configuration (10GB heap size).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
